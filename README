COMP50: Concurrent Programming

===============================================================================
Directories and Files
===============================================================================
wrock.py
    This is the main module that coordinates the entire program. It opens the 
story file and ensures there is a character file in the current directory. It 
collects data about the storyâ€™s tone and characters, and stores that 
information in PTable, so the soundtrack can be created.

tone_alayzer.py
    This module wraps the Watson API so that the main module can call this set 
of functions, instead of interacting with the API directly.

musicGenerator.py
    This module is initialized with a PTable filled with information acquired 
from tone analyzing. The module coordinates threads and pyglet music players to 
play music based off of the tones and characters that appear in the table.

text_to_analyze.txt: 
    This text file contains text to be analyzed and should have each paragraph 
on its own line. (In other words, there should be a new line character only at 
the start of a new paragraph).

characters.txt: 
    Lists the characters in the story that will have a riff during the piece, 
and the corresponding .wav file for this riff.

tones.txt: 
    Lists the tones that will be encountered during the story, and the 
corresponding .wav file to play for that tone. The possible tones are: 
analytical, confident, neutral, tentative, joy, sadness, fear, anger.

Objects: 
    Contains default uncompressed .wav music samples used in demos

Instructions on Running the Code
===============================================================================
To run the program, type the following command into your terminal, 
in the wrock directory:

>  python wrock.py text_to_analyze.txt

To customize music: Users can add more music samples to Wrock by downloading 
uncompressed wav files, and entering the new character/object and the file 
path of the music sample in characters.txt.
