Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station. 
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. 
“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of you — I’ll send you an owl.” 
“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” 
People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: 
“Bye, Harry!” 
“See you, Potter!” 
“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him. 
“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry. 
He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. 
“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!”
